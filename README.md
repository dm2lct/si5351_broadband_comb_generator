# SI5351 broadband comb generator

# A tightrope walk between cost efficiency and RF-performance...

## Specs

The idea was, to build a programmable comb generator for RF and EMC measurements to validate some measurement gear like EMC receivers and to act as a reference source for some EMC measurement environments. 

To achieve a variable distance in the output spectrum, a programmable oscillator SI5351C is used. This SI5351C allows also to provide an external reference signal. Through this, it is possible to feed an external 10 MHz for example from a GPS-disciplined oscillator to achieve a precice and stable output frequency spectrum.

The goal is to reach an output spectrum with 100 MHz frequency marks up to 10 GHz

Let's see, if my design can do it...
